# Why I am open sourcing 2,500 hours of work on my startup idea and what I learned from it

Once upon a time, I had an entrepreneurial dream. I chased the dream, recruited others and spent over 2,500 hours of spare time to make it become reality. Now, after 6+ years of passion, I have decided to let the project go and open source it all. This blog documents my journey and key takeaways. It serves as a ceremonial farewell that hopefully inspires other aspiring entrepreneurs. Keep reading if you are curious and want to learn from my experience in starting a technology start-up.

### Why am I sharing this?

Statistically speaking, I have to admit that I failed. Although I knew the [statistics](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/) upfront - 90% of startups fail within 3 years - I, of course, thought that I could be one of the ten that actually makes it. The reality is that I haven’t made a dime (yet). I did, however, learn a lot. And reflecting on my adventure, I think there are a couple of lessons that others could benefit from. May this blog be a source of inspiration and insight that will help those others in realising their entrepreneurial dreams. And last but not least, as I will be open sourcing my work, may my efforts help other entrepreneurs to kick-start their own adventures.

### What is the idea?

The reason why I enjoyed the project for so long (2015 - 2021) is that my idea combined my two greatest passions: travelling and data. On the plane towards a holiday, I was thinking: “there are so many beautiful places in the world that I don’t know of; why isn’t there a data-driven recommendation system for this?”.

When looking for holiday inspiration, most people have some (quantifiable) ideas about what they want: a certain temperature, a particular continent or region, whether to go for a city trip or nature visit, and sometimes people even have specific activities in mind like skiing, surfing, or mountain climbing. The idea is to gather all this information and to help future travellers find their ideal holiday destination that they would otherwise never have thought of.

The target audience are yuppies (young urban professionals) just like me: people who have enough money but with limited vacation days. Our group is keen on adventure, likes non-standard holiday destinations, and we want our holiday to be “off the beaten track”. Compared to backpackers, our limited amount of vacation days makes us want to get the maximum out of our holiday, so we plan carefully ahead. The goal of the holiday is not per se to relax, but more to have an authentic and unique experience that we can boast about to our fellow colleagues at home afterwards.

When starting the initiative in 2015, making money wasn’t our top priority. The prevailing thought amongst our advisors was: as long as you have users, you can always monetize it later. There were several potential business models to be explored, including affiliate sales, advertising, destination marketing, a Pinterest-like mood board, selling data trends, and white-labeling our data and algorithms. So there we went, aiming to grow a significant user base just like Twitter and hoping to find a revenue stream along the way.

### How did I approach it?

When I started, I realised that I don’t have all the required skills myself. Data expertise: check. But we would also need a software engineer for the app/website and a strategist for the business side. So I pitched the idea to two friends (Arno and Bram) who both liked it and jumped onboard.

We started with an all-night hackathon that soon led to [our first Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgMXNA8Dj80). It looked hacky but it validated our first question: can we get the required data together? The answer is yes, there is lot’s of interesting data publicly available on sites like Wikitravel, Open Street Maps, GeoNames, Numbeo, NOAA, etcetera.

Our second step was also a good start: validate the idea with people. We got the idea for early validation from books like [The Lean Startup from Eric Reis](https://www.amazon.nl/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses/dp/0670921602). We started a Facebook group with friends who wanted to test our product. And we joined a startup competition for students of the University of Amsterdam. Although both these channels didn’t tell us whether people would actually want to pay for the product, we did get confirmation that we were on to something; our friends (of course) liked our idea and we also won the first round of the startup competition in the spring of 2016.

This boosted our confidence. We added an User Experience (UX) expert to the team (GJ) and a marketeer (Vaenisaa) with the idea to make the product more user friendly and to attract users. With the five of us we enrolled in an accelerator program at [ACE](https://ace-incubator.nl/) in the fall of 2016, but it turned out that not all of us were equally dedicated to make it a success. We all did this part-time and study or work was still more important than entrepreneurial success.

To become big, there was a lot of work to be done. But with the five of us, we unfortunately did not get five times as much done. We suddenly lost more time on communication and we lost development speed by spending too much time on things like the [Value Proposition Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas) in the accelerator program. We became inefficient and decided to scale back to only the three technical people.

With this team we upgraded our product to a second MVP and we perfected our pitch for the finals of the ACE startup program... which [we won](https://siliconcanals.com/news/startups/stairway-travel-wins-amsterdam-startup-challenge/)! The price was five thousand euro in funds to invest. Things were looking pretty good now: we got a team of three people, a nice demo product and we got confirmation from an incubator that believed in us. Time to boom?

### The bust

Winning the startup competition led to a reality-check moment. We came to the conclusion that if we really want this, we should significantly spend more time and cannot continue with a full-time job or study. Each of us had to make a choice between the risky entrepreneurial path and the security of a master’s degree and job, which unfortunately meant stopping for my two partners. And who can blame them? I already obtained a university degree and was therefore taking less risk in that regard. We said goodbye and I was riding solo again...

Being on my own, I didn’t quite know what to do. I really liked my previous partners who were there with me from the start, and therefore I didn’t feel like finding and onboarding new co-founders again. However, I also didn’t have the hard skills to take over the frontend and backend work by myself. Eventually I stumbled on [ReWork by Jason Fried](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) who argues to “grow slow and see what feels right - premature hiring is the death of many companies”. He advises to “never hire anyone to do a job until you’ve tried to do it yourself first”. That got me thinking: maybe I did involve too many people too soon… Why can’t I do frontend and backend work myself? So that’s what I did: I embarked on a journey to teach myself the missing skills and 3 years later in 2020 I was able to relaunch the product - with a superb frontend that I am still proud of!

With renewed energy I started pitching the idea again in the Dutch travel industry, which eventually led to talks on possibly merging my website with another. This was the moment: I could now finally become a real entrepreneur!

But then: Covid-19 hit the Netherlands (February 2020). The outlook for a travel startup suddenly became very dark… The end you already know: I decided to stop and focus on more promising opportunities at my AI consultancy job for [GoDataDriven](https://godatadriven.com/).

### Why did I stop?

Where I was firmly convinced of my startup idea in the past, I lost the required faith and energy to keep the project going.

Faith I lost during 2020. My idea would disrupt the travel market, but all of a sudden I ran into three issues. First, due to Covid-19 there was no travel market anymore and it became (and still is) incredibly difficult to judge when and how tourism would come back. Secondly, I read [Grand Hotel Europa by Ilja Leonard Pfeijffer](https://iljapfeijffer.com/en/work/prose/grand-hotel-europa/) where the author makes an excellent point about how mass tourism and the willingness to experience ‘authentic’ destinations actually corrupts those same places. It doesn’t feel right to enable this type of tourism any longer. Thirdly, I came to the realisation that travelling, especially by plane, is not at all environmentally friendly. In fact, tourism is responsible for roughly [8% of the world's carbon emissions](https://sustainabletravel.org/issues/carbon-footprint-tourism/). I need to pivot my current proposition to avoid contributing to that.

With the loss of faith came also the loss of energy. In my mid-twenties, when I started developing my ideas, I could easily work at night and sleep a bit less to nurture my entrepreneurial baby. Now, I have a real baby and sleep has become scarce. Although I was still working on the idea, I noticed that with the loss of faith, my spare time priorities slowly shifted to things like seeing friends, gaming or even napping. It became harder to motivate myself and my entrepreneurial ambitions for this project came to a halt early in 2021.

It would definitely have helped if I still had a business partner at this point with whom to brainstorm, pivot the proposition, and turn the tide in terms of faith and hence energy. It takes two to tango, and I now realise that is both a blessing and a curse to be able to do everything by yourself.

### What have I learned? What can I advise you?

Entrepreneurship takes (a lot of!) time and perseverance. I believe that it’s a process of ups and downs with key make-or-break moments in which you have to take a leap of faith. I didn’t make it, but I have three main learnings that will hopefully help others make the leap:

1. _Align your ambitions_. It’s one thing to work together in an informal setting, but when a key make-or-break moment arrives: is everyone prepared to put in the same amount of time and energy and pull out all the stops? If you don’t intend to turn your dream into a full-time profession, what more is it than just a… hobby?

2. _Don’t go solo_. If you want and have the energy, I believe that you can teach yourself anything. The advantage is that you can work independently and that you can adhere to your own quality standards. The downside is that it takes too much time and you lose yourself in details. This is where my entrepreneurial dream slowly became a hobby: I was okay with learning both frontend and backend engineering and slowly drifted away from the commercial aspect of the project.

3. _Focus on earning money_. Paying customers have demands which help you to align internal ambitions and make deliverables and timelines concrete. Reflecting on this, I read this [great blog](https://tjcx.me/p/i-wasted-40k-on-a-fantastic-startup-idea) of a fellow failed entrepreneur who explains well that you can’t just create value for a user; that’s a charity. To succeed, you must create value for all entities involved, including your own company…

With a technology product as ours, it is tempting to spend too much time on unimportant details. Especially when you are working solo. The most progress was made when we were still a team and when there were deadlines for coaches, partners or startup competitions.

### What now? Why open source it all?

Over the years, I turned Stairway to Travel from an idea into reality. I have branding material, pitch decks, data, algorithms, and a solid frontend and backend that constitute a stable and scalable website. I think it would be a shame if all this would just be collecting dust. As I still think that data-driven travel recommendations could be of value, I hope someone else picks it up and creates a product that would at least help me in any future search for nice holiday destinations.

Open-source lowers the barriers to adoption and collaboration. If I am romanticising, Stairway to Travel could become a collective effort wherein we can make the beauty of the world visible to anyone. Open-source means transparency, and that means any user can trust the website’s unbiased recommendations.

I have used many open-source tools in the creation of the website as it currently stands. How cool is it that I can now give something back to the community? It would be an honour to hear that someone else would benefit from my work.

If you are interested in the project, please feel free to check out the [frontend](https://github.com/stevennooijen/stairwaytotravel-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/stevennooijen/stairwaytotravel-backend) code repositories. I have licensed the code under the very permissive [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), meaning you are free to do almost anything you want with my work. Enjoy!

### Any last words?

It has been a hell of a ride. I don’t regret the crazy amount of spare time and energy that I put into this, as it taught me a lot.

I learned about entrepreneurship in the broadest sense (startup-life, business models, networking, legal aspects, …). I learned about marketing (what it takes to get users to your platform). I learned about technology (how to build a website end-to-end). I learned about taxes and bookkeeping. And lastly, I learned about myself that I am good at setting things up, but that I really value a good partner to bring a project to the next level.

If you have any ideas or thoughts about this blog or Stairway to Travel, please feel free to reach out and connect. I would be glad to help.

If you have your own entrepreneurial dream I hope this blog encourages you to go on and that my learnings will help you make the right decisions. Believe in yourself and best of luck!
